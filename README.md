## Modifications (Commits):

[1] - Initialised the git with git init and added the .ignore file to ignore the metadata files, executable files and confs folder (I only wanted to upload the program files)

[2] - Added the header files for each corresponding cpp file. Also added this README file to keep track of updates and explain how to use the programs to create an executable file.

[3] - Added the #include statements for each file and wrote the contructors for the classes in the header files.

[4] - Wrote the uniform and distance functions, created a makefile, edited the .gitignore to ignore object files and changed r to radius in disk.cpp
